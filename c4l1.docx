Lab: Getting Help in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Performance Checklist

In this lab, you will look up information to help you complete tasks in man pages and GNU Info documents.

Outcomes

You should be able to:

Locate relevant commands by searching man pages and Info nodes.

Learn new options for commonly used documentation commands.

Use appropriate tools to view and print documentation and other non-text formatted files.

Log in to workstation as student using student as the password.

On workstation, run the lab help-review start command.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab help-review start
On workstation, determine how to prepare a man page for printing. Specifically, find what format or rendering language is used for printing.

Use the man man command to determine how to prepare a man page for printing.

[student@worksation ~]$ man man
...output omitted...
Press q to quit the man page.

Note
man uses -t to prepare a man page for printing, using PostScript.

Create a formatted output file of the passwd man page. Call the file passwd.ps. Determine the file content format. Inspect the contents of the passwd.ps file.

Note
Create formatted output of the passwd man page using the following command:

[student@workstation $]$ man -t passwd > passwd.ps
The > symbol redirects the contents of the man page to the passwd.ps file. This command is taught in more detail in a following chapter.

Use the man -t command to create a formatted file of the passwd man page.

[student@workstation ~]$ man -t passwd > passwd.ps
[student@workstation ~]$ ls -al
...output omitted...
-rw-rw-r--. 1 student student  19947 Feb 26 11:14 passwd.ps
...output omitted...
Use the file command to determine the file content format.

[student@workstation ~]$ file /home/student/passwd.ps
passwd.ps: PostScript document text conforming DSC level 3.0
Use the less command to view the /home/student/passwd.ps file.

[student@workstation ~]$ less /home/student/passwd.ps
%!PS-Adobe-3.0
%%Creator: groff version 1.22.3
%%CreationDate: Tue Feb 26 11:14:40 2019
%%DocumentNeededResources: font Times-Roman
%%+ font Times-Bold
%%+ font Times-Italic
%%+ font Symbol
%%DocumentSuppliedResources: procset grops 1.22 3
...output omitted...
Note
The output of file asserts that the file is in the PostScript format, and you have confirmed it by viewing its contents. Notice the header lines of PostScript information. Use q to quit the less command.

Using man, learn the commands used for viewing and printing PostScript files.

Using man learn the commands used for viewing and printing PostScript files.

[student@workstation ~]# man -k postscript viewer
evince (1)           - GNOME document viewer
evince-previewer (1) - show a printing preview of PostScript and PDF documents
evince-thumbnailer (1) - create png thumbnails from PostScript and PDF documents
gcm-viewer (1)       - GNOME Color Manager Profile Viewer Tool
gnome-logs (1)       - log viewer for the systemd journal
grops (1)            - PostScript driver for groff
pango-view (1)       - Pango text viewer
pluginviewer (8)     - list loadable SASL plugins and their properties
Note
Using multiple words with the -k option finds man pages matching either word; those with "postscript" or "viewer" in their descriptions. Notice the evince(1) commands in the output.

Learn how to use the evince(1) viewer in preview mode. Also, determine how to open a document starting on a specific page.

Use the man evince command to learn how to use the viewer in preview mode.

[student@workstation ~]$ man evince
...output omitted...
Press q to quit the man page.

Note
The -w (or --preview) option opens evince in preview mode. The -i option is used to specify a starting page.

View your PostScript file using the various evince options you researched. Close your document file when you are finished.

Use the evince command to open /home/student/passwd.ps

[student@workstation ~]$ evince /home/student/passwd.ps
Use the evince -w /home/student/passwd.ps command to open the file in preview mode.

[student@workstation ~]$ evince -w /home/student/passwd.ps
Use the evince -i 3 /home/student/passwd.ps command to open the file at page 3.

[student@workstation ~]$ evince -i 3 /home/student/passwd.ps
Note
While normal evince mode allows full screen and presentation style viewing, the evince preview mode is useful for quick browsing and printing. Notice the print icon at the top.

Using the man command, research lp(1) to determine how to print any document starting on a specific page. Without actually entering any commands (because there are no printers), learn the syntax, in one command, to print only pages 2 and 3 of your PostScript file.

Use the man lp command to determine how to print specific pages of a document.

[student@workstation ~]$ man lp
...output omitted...
Press q to quit the man page.

Note
From lp(1), you learn that the -P option specifies pages. The lp command spools to the default printer, sending only the page range starting on 2 and ending on 3. Therefore, one valid answer is lp passwd.ps -P 2-3.

Using pinfo, look for GNU Info documentation about the evince viewer.

Use the pinfo command to look for GNU Info documentation about the evince viewer.

[student@workstation ~]$ pinfo evince
Note
Notice that the evince(1) man page displays instead. The pinfo document viewer looks for a relevant man page when no appropriate GNU documentation node exists for the requested topic. Press q to quit.

Using Firefox, open the system's package documentation directory and browse into the man-db package subdirectory. View the provided manuals.

Use firefox /usr/share/doc to view system documentation. Browse to the man-db subdirectory. Click on the manuals to view them.

[student@workstation ~]$ firefox /usr/share/doc
Note
Bookmarks can be made for any frequently used directory. After browsing to the man-db directory, click to open and view the text version of the manual, then close it. Click to open the PostScript version. As observed earlier, evince is the system's default viewer for PostScript and PDF documents. You may wish to return to these documents later to become more knowledgeable about man. When finished, close the evince viewer.


Using the Firefox browser, locate and browse to the initscripts package subdirectory. View the sysconfig.txt file, which describes important system configuration options stored in the /etc/sysconfig directory.

In the Firefox browser, locate the initscripts package subdirectory.

Notice how useful a browser is for locating and viewing local system documentation. Close the document and Firefox when finished.

Evaluation

On workstation, run lab help-review grade to confirm success of this exercise.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab help-review grade
Finish

On workstation, run the lab help-review finish script to complete this exercise.

[student@workstation ~]$ lab help-review finish
This concludes the lab.
