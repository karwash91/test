🧭 How to Contribute to a Service Page

This project is designed to make documenting your cloud service adoption process as simple and maintainable as possible. Each service has a config.yml file that powers its corresponding webpage. Updating this file is your main contribution — and it’s built to be reductive: start with everything, and narrow it down to only what applies.

Here’s how to contribute effectively:

🛠️ Edit the config.yml File

Click the Edit section button on the service page to jump straight to the file editor for that service’s config.yml. Then follow these best practices:
	•	✅ Use Markdown checkboxes (- [x]) to indicate selected options.
	•	💬 Alternatively, comment out (#) options that don’t apply — or simply delete them.
	•	🔗 When adding links, always use Markdown format:
Example: [Design Document](https://link-to-your-doc)
	•	👀 Look for fields labeled RESPONSIBLE — they show where your team is expected to contribute content or input.

🚨 Don’t Leave Defaults

Each service page displays an alert when default content still needs to be updated. After each commit, automated checks run to ensure that no placeholder or template content remains.

⚠️ If you see this message on a service page:
“Section contains default content and needs to be updated”
…it’s your cue to open the editor and make changes!

💬 Provide Feedback or Flag Issues

Use the Create issue button to suggest improvements, report problems, or request guidance.

🕓 Track Changes

Click View history to review the commit log for the service’s config.yml. This helps with auditing updates or understanding when and why a change was made.
